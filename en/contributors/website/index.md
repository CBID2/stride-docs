- Markdown
- Mainly [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and a bit Nunjucks (template engines)
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome
- HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SCSS, and JSON
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

  - For personal testing or demonstration purposes, you might need to set up your own GitHub Actions. This can be particularly useful if you want to showcase proposed changes to maintainers for approval
