# Donating to Stride
In order to support our contributors or if we want to finance a specific feature, we collect donations from individuals as well as organisations. 

## Open Collective
We gather funding through a website called [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/stride3d). This website displays were al the money is coming from and where it is going to: 100% transparency guaranteed.

## Projects
Stride's Open Collective hosts different '[Projects](https://opencollective.com/stride3d/projects)' — think of them as funding goals for specific features or contributions. Each project typically has a related Github ticket for more details on what's required for its development. If you're interested in working on or contributing to a particular feature, please reply in the thread and mention @stride3d/stride-contributors.
